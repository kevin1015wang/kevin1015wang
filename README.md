# myMLH MCP Integration

This repository contains a minimal README documenting the myMLH (MyMLH) MCP integration and a short summary of the authenticated myMLH profile accessible to this environment.

**Profile Summary**
- **Name:** Kevin Wang
- **Professional Experience:** Software Engineer / Intern roles (examples include Uber, Whirlpool, LECO)
- **Education:** Computer Science, University of Michigan

**myMLH MCP Usage**
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how to read the authenticated myMLH profile and token metadata (do NOT commit secrets).
- **Available operations (via myMLH tools):** `mcp_mymlh_mymlh_get_user`, `mcp_mymlh_mymlh_get_token`, `mcp_mymlh_mymlh_refresh_token`

Example (conceptual):

```
# Fetch profile (example helper provided by the environment)
profile = mcp_mymlh_mymlh_get_user()

# Fetch token metadata (DO NOT store the raw token in version control)
token_meta = mcp_mymlh_mymlh_get_token()
print(token_meta.expires_at)
```

**Security note:** Never commit access tokens or refresh tokens to git. Use environment variables or the platform's secure storage.

**Next steps**
- Add MCP manifest or server scaffold if you want this repo to serve as an MCP provider.
- If you'd like, I can scaffold a minimal MCP server and example handlers in this repo.
